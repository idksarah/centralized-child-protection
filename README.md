## Problem
They tried to teach us internet safety in middle school. They put on videos of which websites were safe to visit, and which websites were bad for us. 
The reality was that not a single person paid attention to those videos. Instead, I had to learn the hard way that good internet surfing is difficult.

**The internet and the kids are evolving. Our teaching material? Not so much.**

The kids of today are deeply ingrained in the digital world—an unsafe place. Kids need to learn cyber safety, yet that can be so tedious and time consuming (something kid’s hate).

## Our product
Centralized Child Protection is a browser extension teaches kids internet safety in an engaging and fun way. By using ~~spyware to read your browsing data~~ specialized coding mechanisms, we calculate a credit score for the user. 
**Furthermore**, we've even got the XJPAI Chat site, where you can talk to Xi Jinping about your credit score. This not only introduces novelty to keep children engaged, it helps provide a _deeper understanding_ of why your score is what it is, and how to improve it. Finally, by incorporating text to speech, children do not have to expend their already minimal attention spans on reading long lines of text; more importantly, the text to speech feature provides greater accessibility access for children with visual impairments.
